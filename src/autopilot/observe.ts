 * into a burst target. Away from a scheduled drop, an availability flip is
 * somebody cancelling, and cancellations happen all day across a whole park.
 * With refill-window polling sampling every six seconds for hours, two park
 * days is enough to promote that noise into burst bands that tile the middle
 * of the day -- the thing the refill window was introduced to avoid.
 *
 * Watched attractions are also the only ones the schedule is ever consulted
 * for, so nothing actionable is lost.
 *
 * `watchedIds` cannot be the whole bound, though, and the comment above quietly
 * assumed it was. A refill window is only declared for an attraction somebody
 * watches, so the very churn this describes -- six-second sampling across a
 * multi-hour span -- happens inside the bound rather than outside it. Jungle
 * Cruise and Haunted Mansion both declare 11:00-14:30, which is around 2,100
 * polls of ordinary refill jitter, and two park days of it was enough to promote
 * that into permanent midday burst bands: the API hammered and the action budget
 * spent, for minutes that were never drops.
 *
 * So a flip inside a declared refill window is not learned from. That is what
 * the window means: inventory returns across this span by design, and a span is
 * not a series of drop instants. The cadence already polls it faster on its own
 * account, so nothing is lost there either.
