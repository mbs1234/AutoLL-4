 * and the same blank favicon. Nothing distinguished them before you opened
 * one and looked at what was on screen.
 *
 * The tab strip is where that question is actually asked, so this is where it
 * is answered. It is the human half of the shared storage namespace: that one
 * stops two builds overwriting each other's data, this one stops you
 * mistaking which is which.
